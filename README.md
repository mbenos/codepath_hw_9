# codepath_hw_9

I followed the instructions and deployed the MHN honeypot (mhn-honeypot-1). The main issue that I encountered was the fact that when I ran the nmap command, more than the 3 expected ports were displayed. Following this, when I went to the Attacks page in the admin console, I could not find my port scan. This was the only attack performed, but I see there are hundreds of other attacks coming in from around the globe. As a follow up, I will be researching how these other computers were able to find my VM despite it recently being set up.
